	--------------------------------
	-On this project, we are using a modular architecture.
	-The project is divided into several modules, each one with its own responsibility.
	-The main entry point is the index.js file, which is the file that will be executed when the project is run.
	-The models are divided into several files, each one with its own responsibility.

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS

	-To do that, you will need to read the error, and understand what it is and separate in tree steps:
